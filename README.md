# The Organic Monorepo

This monorepo contains multiple projects including ayokoding-web, organic-lever-web, associated libraries, and a new F# project called mngr.

## Project Structure

- `apps/`
  - `ayokoding-web/`: Ayokoding web application
  - `organic-lever-web/`: Organic Lever web application
  - `organic-lever-web-e2e/`: End-to-end tests for Organic Lever
- `libs/`
  - `hello/`: Shared library
- `mngr-rs/`: Rust-based repository management tool
- `mngr/`: F# project for repository management

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have [Volta](https://volta.sh/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.

2. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-organic.git`

3. Navigate to the project root:
   `cd the-organic`

4. Run the initialization script:
   `./init.sh`

   This script will build and run the F# project, along with other initialization tasks.

## Repository Management

The `mngr-rs` tool provides several commands to manage the monorepo. Additionally, the new F# project `mngr` has been added for future management tasks.

## F# Project: mngr

To run the F# project:

1. Navigate to the mngr directory:
   `cd mngr`

2. Build the project:
   `dotnet build`

3. Run the project:
   `dotnet run`

For more details about the `mngr` project, see its [README](./mngr/README.md).
